## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Themes

You can customize the giscus theme by changing the `theme` parameter:

```toml
[params.comments.giscus]
  theme = "light"           # Light theme
  theme = "dark"            # Dark theme
  theme = "preferred_color_scheme"  # System preference
  theme = "transparent_dark"        # Transparent dark
  theme = "cobalt"                  # Cobalt theme
  theme = "noborder_light"          # Light without border
  theme = "noborder_dark"           # Dark without border
```

### Comment Position

Change where comments appear:

```toml
[params.comments.giscus]
  inputPosition = "top"     # Comments at top
  inputPosition = "bottom"  # Comments at bottom
```

### Reactions

Enable or disable reactions:

```toml
[params.comments.giscus]
  reactionsEnabled = "1"    # Enable reactions
  reactionsEnabled = "0"    # Disable reactions
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Security
- Keep your repository public for giscus to work
- Use HTTPS for your blog (GitHub Pages enforces this)
- Don't share your repoId/categoryId publicly (though they're not sensitive)

### 2. Performance
- Giscus loads asynchronously, so it won't slow down your blog
- Comments are cached by GitHub's CDN
- No database queries needed

### 3. Moderation
- You can moderate comments through GitHub Discussions
- Set up notifications for new comments
- Use GitHub's built-in moderation tools

### 4. Backup
- Comments are stored in GitHub Discussions
- They're automatically backed up with your repository
- You can export discussions if needed
